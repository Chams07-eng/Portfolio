<p>
    some of the projects that im currently working on are not yet finished but i will be updating them soon. <br>
    <ol>
        <li> Project 1: A web application for managing tasks and to-do lists.</li>
        <img src="images/tech trends.jpg" alt="Project 1" style="width: 50%; height: auto;"></li>
        <li> Project 2: A Python script for automating data analysis.</li>

        </ol>
    </p>
<p>
    im also venturing on programming an AI that uses machine learning and  can interprete natural language with ease<br>
    and also a web application that uses AI to help users with their daily tasks.<br>
    the AI is going to be kind of the same with chat gpt but without the limited access <br>
    and also the web application is going to be a bit different from the chat gpt<br>
</p>
